## Reflection

This React app utilizing Firebase, revolves around the google books API and allows you to search through books/magazines throughout all of history(essentially). Click on a book you like to find out more about it, and add it to your favorites or click the link in order to purchase it.

The technologies used were React(in order to challenge myself to build out a full fledged React App utilizing reusable components), Firebase(easy to get started with and free), axios(helped to make the API calls much more readable), fontAwesome(easy to get started with and looks good), react-spinner(simple spinner for loading states)

Some challenges were: Passing props throughout the different components (especially passing references to the handleSubmit function in App.js to bookCart.js and so on), Effectively breaking up portions into smaller components, Connecting Firebase and implementing some basic CRUD operations on it
